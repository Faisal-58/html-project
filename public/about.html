<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, My name is Faisal Ijaz and I am a Web developer.Traditionally, I do not belong to a technical background.
   I have done Masters in Materials Science and Engineering from CAU Kiel. As the world is progressing at a rapid pace,
   the knowledge of programming is essential to compete in modern world. I was always facinated by programers and
   how they operate, so that's why I acquired technical knwoledge to excel in the field of developing. My aim is to become
   a high ranked full stack developer.</p>
